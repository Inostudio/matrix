The whole SDK has been refactored!

- All data objects such as `MyUser`, `Room`, etc. are now immutable
- Add `MoorStore`, which uses [moor](https://pub.dev/packages/moor)
  (thanks to Mathieu Velten for the idea and initial implementation!)
- The `SqfliteStore` (was in a seperate package) is now deprecated
- `LocalUser` has been renamed to `MyUser`

There are a _lot_ more changes, see the README on how to use the
SDK.

Some features previously present may not have been added yet again.
They will be added in the future!
