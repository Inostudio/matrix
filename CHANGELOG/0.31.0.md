- Add the ability to defer all processing to a different isolate
  When you use `isolated: true` on `Homeserver.login` or `MyUser.fromStore`,
  everything will be handled for you and the SDK works the same.
  
  This only works on platforms with the Dart VM (not web).
- `Updater`s are now globally registered per `MyUser` `id`. This means for now only
  one `Updater` per `MyUser` is allowed. `Updater`s are created when a `MyUser` instance
  is retrieved via `Homeserver.login` or `MyUser.fromStore`
- Add ability to specify what rooms to load from store when retrieving
  user
- The `previousBatch` param from `Room.copyWith` is removed (wasn't used)
- Add ability to override context in `MyUser.copyWith` and `MyUser.merge`
- `Updater` and `Homeserver` are less coupled now
- When a `Context` is changed with `copyWith`, all child objects' `context`s
  are also changed
- Fix bug in read receipt parsing (thanks to Mathieu Velten!)
- Sync errors are now pushed to the `updates` stream
- Fix access token not being passed to logout API
- Add `type` to `RequestUpdate`, so you can see which type of call
  the update was caused by
- Moor has been updated
- And other minor fixes!
