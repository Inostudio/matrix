- Rename `AvatarUrlChangeEvent` to `AvatarChangeEvent`
- Rename `AvatarChangeEvent` to `RoomAvatarChangeEvent`
- Rename `NameChangeEvent` to `RoomNameChangeEvent`
- Add `RoomCreationEvent`
- `members.get()` returns oldest user state if
  the given time (`at`) is lower than any known state.
- Fix state not being processed properly if room was newly
  created. Now all processing of events is done in a single
  function.
