- **Databases are now deleted as a migration strategy**
  
  This will be in effect until 1.0 (or a bit before). If needed, make
  a backup between every minor version bump.

- `Room.myMembership` has been removed, use `Room.me.membership`
- Add `Rooms.enter` and `Room.join` to join rooms
- Add `Room.leave` method
- Add `PublicRooms`
- Add useful getts to `Member` like `isInvited` or `hasJoined`
- Remove `AliasesChangeEvent`
- Errors in the separate isolate are now added to the `updates` stream where possible,
  or thrown in the calling isolate
- Fix profile API not working on servers where authorization is required
- Add `MyUser.hasSynced`
- Fix `count` not being nullable in `MemberTimeline.load`
- More fixes and small changes!
