- **Add paginating functionality to `Storables`**

  A new method has been added to `Storables`: `paginate`. This can be used to
  get a 'page' of items (like from the `Timeline`).

- Remove use of `Stream`s

  `Storables` methods that returned `Stream<T>` before will now return
  a `Future<Iterable<T>>`

- Process state when fetching events remotely

  This means that the user states are now correctly set for
  remote messages!

- Don't parse events with invalid user IDs
- Add `MemoryStore`

Changes thanks to Mathieu:
- Remote `state_key` from `StateEventContent`
- Fix parsing of redaction of state events
- Add `upload` method to `LocalUser`
- Use `Stream<List<int>>` for `upload` and `download` method
  instead of `Uint8List`
